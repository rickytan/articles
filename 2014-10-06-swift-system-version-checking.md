While it's not accurate to say that Swift is "Objective-C without the C", it's for lack of resemblance to Objective-C, not the absence of C. Swift is _vehemently_ **_not_** C.

Swift certainly draws inspiration from Haskell, Rust, Python, D, and other modern languages, but one can perhaps best understand the language as a rejection of everything that's broken in C:

- C is **unsafe** by default. Swift is **safe** by default _(hence the `unsafe` naming of pointer manipulation functions)_.
- C has **undefined behavior**. Swift has **well-defined behavior** _(or at least theoretically; the compiler tools still have some catching up to do)_.
- C uses **preprocessor directives capable of unspeakable evil**. Swift has a **safe subset of preprocessor directives**.

> One could go as far to say that Swift's type system was specifically designed out of _spite_ for C++.

In Objective-C, checking for the availability of an API was accomplished through a combination of C preprocessor directives, conditionals on `class`, `respondsToSelector:`, and `instancesRespondToSelector:`:

~~~{objective-c}
#if defined(__IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED) && __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED >= 70000
if ([NSURLSession class] &&
    [NSURLSessionConfiguration respondsToSelector:@selector(backgroundSessionConfigurationWithIdentifier:)]) {
    // ...
}
#endif
~~~

However, as noted previously, Swift's compiler directives are [extremely constrained](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/InteractingWithCAPIs.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014216-CH8-XID_20), allowing only for compiler flags and conditional compilation against specific operating systems and architectures:

~~~{swift}
#if DEBUG
     println("OTHER_SWIFT_FLAGS = -D DEBUG")
#endif
~~~

| Function | Valid Arguments                    |
|----------|------------------------------------|
| `os()`   | `OSX`, `iOS`                      |
| `arch()` | `x86_64`, `arm`, `arm64`, `i386`   |

~~~{swift}
#if os(iOS)
    var image: UIImage?
#elseif os(OSX)
    var image: NSImage?
#endif
~~~

Unfortunately, `os()` does not offer any insight into the specific version of OS X or iOS, which means that checks must be made at runtime. And with Swift's less-forgiving [treatment of `nil`](http://nshipster.com/nil/), checking for constants Objective-C-style results in a crash.

So how do you check the system version in Swift to determine API availability? Read on to find out.

* * *

## NSProcessInfo

Anticipating the need for a Swift-friendly API for determining API version at runtime, iOS 8 introduces the `operatingSystemVersion` property and `isOperatingSystemAtLeastVersion` method on `NSProcessInfo`. Both APIs use a new `NSOperatingSystemVersion` value type, which contains the `majorVersion`, `minorVersion`, and `patchVersion`.

> Apple software releases follow [semantic versioning](http://semver.org) conventions.

### isOperatingSystemAtLeastVersion

For a simple check, like "is this app running on iOS 8?", `isOperatingSystemAtLeastVersion` is the most straightforward approach.

~~~{swift}
if NSProcessInfo().isOperatingSystemAtLeastVersion(NSOperatingSystemVersion(majorVersion: 8, minorVersion: 0, patchVersion: 0)) {
    println("iOS >= 8.0.0")
}
~~~

### operatingSystemVersion

For more involved version comparison, the `operatingSystemVersion` can be inspected directly. Combine this with Swift pattern matching and `switch` statements for syntactic concision:

~~~{swift}
let os = NSProcessInfo().operatingSystemVersion
switch (os.majorVersion, os.minorVersion, os.patchVersion) {
case (8, _, _):
    println("iOS >= 8.0.0")
case (7, 0, _):
    println("iOS >= 7.0.0, < 7.1.0")
case (7, _, _):
    println("iOS >= 7.1.0, < 8.0.0")
default:
    println("iOS < 7.0.0")
}
~~~

## UIDevice systemVersion

Ironically, the new `NSProcessInfo` APIs aren't especially useful at the time of writing, since they're unavailable for iOS 7.

As an alternative, one can use the `systemVersion` property `UIDevice`:

~~~{swift}
switch UIDevice.currentDevice().systemVersion.compare("8.0.0", options: NSStringCompareOptions.NumericSearch) {
case .OrderedSame, .OrderedDescending:
    println("iOS >= 8.0")
case .OrderedAscending:
    println("iOS < 8.0")
}
~~~

> Use `NSStringCompareOptions.NumericSearch` when comparing version number strings to ensure that, for example, `"2.5" < "2.10"`.

String comparison and `NSComparisonResult` aren't as sexy as a dedicated value type like `NSOperatingSystemVersion`, but it gets the job done all the same.

## NSAppKitVersionNumber

Another approach to determining API availability is to check framework version numbers. Unfortunately, Foundation's `NSFoundationVersionNumber` and Core Foundation's `kCFCoreFoundationVersionNumber` have historically been out of date, missing constants for past OS releases.

This is a dead-end for iOS, but OS X can pretty reliably check against the version of AppKit, with `NSAppKitVersionNumber`:

~~~{swift}
if rint(NSAppKitVersionNumber) > NSAppKitVersionNumber10_9 {
    println("OS X >= 10.10")
}
~~~

> Apple uses `rint` in sample code to round off version numbers for `NSAppKitVersionNumber` comparison.

* * *

To summarize, here's what you need to know about checking the system version in Swift:

- Use `#if os(iOS)` preprocessor directives to distinguish between iOS (UIKit) and OS X (AppKit) targets.
- For minimum deployment targets of iOS 8.0 or above, use `NSProcessInfo` `operatingSystemVersion` or `isOperatingSystemAtLeastVersion`.
- For minimum deployment targets of iOS 7.1 or below, use `compare` with `NSStringCompareOptions.NumericSearch` on `UIDevice` `systemVersion`.
- For OS X deployment targets, compare `NSAppKitVersionNumber` against available AppKit constants.
