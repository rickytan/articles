Objective-C required us to [wax philosophic](http://nshipster.com/equality/) about the nature of equality and identity. To the relief of any developer less inclined towards handwavy treatises, this is not as much the case for Swift.

In Swift, `Equatable` is a fundamental type, from which `Comparable` and `Hashable` are both derived. Together, these protocols form the central point of comparison throughout the language.

* * *

## Equatable

Values of the `Equatable` type can be evaluated for equality and inequality. Declaring a type as equatable bestows several useful abilities, notably the ability values of that type to be found in a containing `Array`.

For a type to be `Equatable`, there must exist an implementation of the `==` operator function, which accepts a matching type:

~~~{swift}
func ==(lhs: Self, rhs: Self) -> Bool
~~~

For value types, equality is determined by evaluating the equality of each component property. As an example, consider a `Complex` type, which takes a generic type `T`, which conforms to `SignedNumberType`:

> `SignedNumberType` is a convenient choice for a generic number type, as it inherits from both `Comparable` (and thus `Equatable`, as described in the section) and `IntegerLiteralConvertible`, which `Int`, `Double`, and `Float` all conform to.

~~~{swift}
struct Complex<T: SignedNumberType> {
    let real: T
    let imaginary: T
}
~~~

Since a [complex number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number) is comprised of a real and imaginary component, two complex numbers are equal if and only if their respective real and imaginary components are equal:

~~~{swift}
extension Complex: Equatable {}

// MARK: Equatable

func ==<T>(lhs: Complex<T>, rhs: Complex<T>) -> Bool {
    return lhs.real == rhs.real && lhs.imaginary == rhs.imaginary
}
~~~

The result:

~~~swift
let a = Complex<Double>(real: 1.0, imaginary: 2.0)
let b = Complex<Double>(real: 1.0, imaginary: 2.0)

a == b // true
a != b // false
~~~

> As described in [the article about Swift Default Protocol Implementations](http://nshipster.com/swift-default-protocol-implementations/), an implementation of `!=` is automatically derived from the provided `==` operator by the standard library.

For reference types, the equality becomes conflated with identity. It makes sense that two `Name` structs with the same values would be equal, but two `Person` objects can have the same name, but be different people.

For Objective-C-compatible object types, the `==` operator is already provided from the `isEqual:` method:

~~~{swift}
class ObjCObject: NSObject {}

ObjCObject() == ObjCObject() // false
~~~

For Swift reference types, equality can be evaluated as an identity check on an `ObjectIdentifier` constructed with an instance of that type:

~~~{swift}
class Object: Equatable {}

// MARK: Equatable

func ==(lhs: Object, rhs: Object) -> Bool {
    return ObjectIdentifier(lhs) == ObjectIdentifier(rhs)
}

Object() == Object() // false
~~~

## Comparable

Building on `Equatable`, the `Comparable` protocol allows for more specific inequality, distinguishing cases where the left hand value is greater than or less than the right hand value.

Types conforming to the `Comparable` protocol provide the following operators:

~~~{swift}
func <=(lhs: Self, rhs: Self) -> Bool
func >(lhs: Self, rhs: Self) -> Bool
func >=(lhs: Self, rhs: Self) -> Bool
~~~

What's interesting about this list, however, is not so much what is _included_, but rather what's _missing_.

The first and perhaps most noticeable omission is `==`, since `>=` is a logical disjunction of `>` and `==` comparisons. As a way of reconciling this, `Comparable` inherits from `Equatable`, which provides `==`.

The second omission is a bit more subtle, and is actually the key to understanding what's going on here: `<`. What happened to the "less than" operator? It's defined by the `_Comparable` protocol. Why is this significant? As described in [the article about Swift Default Protocol Implementations](http://nshipster.com/swift-default-protocol-implementations/), the Swift Standard Library provides a default implementation of the `Comparable` protocol based entirely on the existential type `_Comparable`. This is actually _really_ clever. Since the implementations of all of the comparison functions can be derived from just `<` and `==`, all of that functionality is made available automatically through type inference.

> Contrast this with, for example, how Ruby derives equality and comparison operators from a single operator, `<=>` (a.k.a the "UFO operator"). [Here's how this could be implemented in Swift](https://gist.github.com/mattt/7e4db72ce1b6c8a18bb4).

As a more complex example, consider a `CSSSelector` struct, which implements [cascade ordering](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/cascade.html#cascading-order) of selectors:

~~~{swift}
import Foundation

struct CSSSelector {
    let selector: String

    struct Specificity {
        let id: Int
        let `class`: Int
        let element: Int

        init(_ components: [String]) {
            var (id, `class`, element) = (0, 0, 0)
            for token in components {
                if token.hasPrefix("#") {
                    id++
                } else if token.hasPrefix(".") {
                    `class`++
                } else {
                    element++
                }
            }

            self.id = id
            self.`class` = `class`
            self.element = element
        }
    }

    let specificity: Specificity

    init(_ string: String) {
        self.selector = string

        // Naïve tokenization, ignoring operators, pseudo-selectors, and `style=`.
        let components: [String] = self.selector.componentsSeparatedByCharactersInSet(NSCharacterSet.whitespaceCharacterSet())
        self.specificity = Specificity(components)
    }
}
~~~

Where as CSS selectors are evaluated by specificity rank and order, two selectors are only really equal if they resolve to the same elements:

~~~{swift}
extension CSSSelector: Equatable {}

// MARK: Equatable

func ==(lhs: CSSSelector, rhs: CSSSelector) -> Bool {
    // Naïve equality that uses string comparison rather than resolving equivalent selectors
    return lhs.selector == rhs.selector
}
~~~

Instead, selectors are actually compared in terms of their specificity:

~~~{swift}
extension CSSSelector.Specificity: Comparable {}

// MARK: Comparable

func <(lhs: CSSSelector.Specificity, rhs: CSSSelector.Specificity) -> Bool {
    return lhs.id < rhs.id ||
        lhs.`class` < rhs.`class` ||
        lhs.element < rhs.element
}

// MARK: Equatable

func ==(lhs: CSSSelector.Specificity, rhs: CSSSelector.Specificity) -> Bool {
    return lhs.id == rhs.id &&
           lhs.`class` == rhs.`class` &&
           lhs.element == rhs.element
}
~~~

Bringing everything together:

> For clarity, assume `CSSSelector` [conforms to `StringLiteralConvertible`](http://nshipster.com/swift-literal-convertible/).

~~~{swift}
let a: CSSSelector = "#logo"
let b: CSSSelector = "html body #logo"
let c: CSSSelector = "body div #logo"
let d: CSSSelector = ".container #logo"

b == c // false
b.specificity == c.specificity // true
c.specificity < a.specificity // false
d.specificity > c.specificity // true
~~~

## Hashable

Another important protocol derived from `Equatable` is `Hashable`.

Only `Hashable` types can be stored as the key of a Swift `Dictionary`:

~~~{swift}
struct Dictionary<Key : Hashable, Value> : CollectionType, DictionaryLiteralConvertible { ... }
~~~

For a type to conform to `Hashable`, it must provide a getter for the `hashValue` property.

~~~{swift}
protocol Hashable : Equatable {
    /// Returns the hash value.  The hash value is not guaranteed to be stable
    /// across different invocations of the same program.  Do not persist the hash
    /// value across program runs.
    ///
    /// The value of `hashValue` property must be consistent with the equality
    /// comparison: if two values compare equal, they must have equal hash
    /// values.
    var hashValue: Int { get }
}
~~~

Determining the [optimal hashing value](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_hash_function) is way outside the scope of this article. Fortunately, most values can derive an adequate hash value from an `XOR` of the hash values of its component properties.

The following built-in Swift types implement `hashValue`:

- `Double`
- `Float`, `Float80`
- `Int`, `Int8`, `Int16`, `Int32`, `Int64`
- `UInt`, `UInt8`, `UInt16`, `UInt32`, `UInt64`
- `String`
- `UnicodeScalar`
- `ObjectIdentifier`

Based on this, here's how a struct representing [Binomial Nomenclature in Biological Taxonomy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_nomenclature):

~~~{swift}
struct Binomen {
    let genus: String
    let species: String
}

// MARK: Hashable

extension Binomen: Hashable {
    var hashValue: Int {
        return genus.hashValue ^ species.hashValue
    }
}

// MARK: Equatable

func ==(lhs: Binomen, rhs: Binomen) -> Bool {
    return lhs.genus == rhs.genus && lhs.species == rhs.species
}
~~~

Being able to hash this type makes it possible to key common name to the "Latin name":

~~~{swift}
var commonNames: [Binomen: String] = [:]
commonNames[Binomen(genus: "Canis", species: "lupis")] = "Grey Wolf"
commonNames[Binomen(genus: "Canis", species: "rufus")] = "Red Wolf"
commonNames[Binomen(genus: "Canis", species: "latrans")] = "Coyote"
commonNames[Binomen(genus: "Canis", species: "aureus")] = "Golden Jackal"
~~~
