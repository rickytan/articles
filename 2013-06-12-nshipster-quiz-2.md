title: "NSHipster Quiz #2"

category: Trivia
excerpt: "Go up against some of the brightest minds in all things Apple at this special WWDC edition of NSHipster Quiz. Sure, you conform to the NSHipster protocol, but do you have what it takes to implement all of the @optional methods? Take the quiz and see for yourself!"
---

On June 11th, we organized an NSHipster Pub Quiz for WWDC attendees. Like [our first quiz](http://nshipster.com/nshipster-quiz-1/), questions ranged from random Apple trivia to obscure framework questions. The event was hosted by [New Relic](http://newrelic.com), and sponsored by [Heroku](https://heroku.com) & [Mutual Mobile](http://www.mutualmobile.com). About 100 developers attended the event, with the team "UIResponders" taking top prize.

For everyone that couldn't make it to the event, here's an opportunity to play along at home. Here are some ground rules:

- There are 4 Rounds, with 10 questions each
- Record answers on a separate sheet of paper
- Each correct answer to a question gets you 1 point (unless otherwise specified)
- Play with up to 5 friends for maximum enjoyment
- Don't be lame and look things up on the Internet or in Xcode
