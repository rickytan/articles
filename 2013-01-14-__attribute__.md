A recurring theme of this publication has been the importance of a healthy relationship with the compiler. Like any craft, one's effectiveness as a practitioner is contingent on how they treat their tools. Take good care of them, and they'll take good care of you.

`__attribute__` is a compiler directive that specifies characteristics on declarations, which allows for more error checking and advanced optimizations.

The syntax for this keyword is `__attribute__` followed by two sets of parentheses (the double parentheses makes it easy to "macro out", especially with multiple attributes). Inside the parentheses is a comma-delimited list of attributes. `__attribute__` directives are placed after function, variable, and type declarations.

~~~{objective-c}
// Return the square of a number
int square(int n) __attribute__((const));

// Declare the availability of a particular API
void f(void)
  __attribute__((availability(macosx,introduced=10.4,deprecated=10.6)));

// Send printf-like message to stderr and exit
extern void die(const char *format, ...)
  __attribute__((noreturn, format(printf, 1, 2)));
~~~

If this is starting to remind you of ISO C's [`#pragma`](http://nshipster.com/pragma), you're not alone.

In fact, when `__attribute__` was first introduced to GCC, it was faced with some resistance by some who suggested that `#pragma` be used exclusively for the same purposes.

There were, however, two very good reasons why `__attribute__` was added:

> 1. It was impossible to generate `#pragma` commands from a macro (before the C99 `_Pragma` operator).
> 2. There is no telling what the same `#pragma` might mean in another compiler.

Quoth the [GCC Documentation for Function Attributes](http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Function-Attributes.html):

> These two reasons applied to almost any application that might have been proposed for `#pragma`. It was basically a mistake to use `#pragma` for anything.

Indeed, if you look at modern Objective-C--in the headers of Apple frameworks and well-engineered open-source projects--`__attribute__` is used for myriad purposes. (By contrast, `#pragma`'s main claim to fame these days is decoration: `#pragma mark`)

So without further ado, let's take a look at the most important attributes:

---

GCC
---

### `format`

> The `format` attribute specifies that a function takes `printf`, `scanf`, `strftime` or `strfmon` style arguments which should be type-checked against a format string.

~~~{objective-c}
extern int
my_printf (void *my_object, const char *my_format, ...)
  __attribute__((format(printf, 2, 3)));
~~~

Objective-C programmers can also use the `__NSString__` format to enforce the same rules as format strings in `NSString +stringWithFormat:` and `NSLog()`.

### `nonnull`

> The `nonnull` attribute specifies that some function parameters should be non-null pointers.

~~~{objective-c}
extern void *
my_memcpy (void *dest, const void *src, size_t len)
  __attribute__((nonnull (1, 2)));
~~~

Using `nonnull` encodes expectations about values into an explicit contract, which can help catch any `NULL` pointer bugs lurking in any calling code. Remember: compile-time errors ≫ run-time errors.

### `noreturn`

> A few standard library functions, such as `abort` and `exit`, cannot return. GCC knows this automatically. The `noreturn` attribute specifies this for any other function that never returns.

For example, AFNetworking [uses the `noreturn` attribute for its network request thread entry point method](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking/blob/1.1.0/AFNetworking/AFURLConnectionOperation.m#L157). This method is used when spawning the dedicated network `NSThread` to ensure that the detached thread continues execution for the lifetime of the application.

### `pure` / `const`

> The `pure` attribute specifies that a function has no effects except the return value, such that their return value depends only on the parameters and/or global variables. Such a function can be subject to common subexpression elimination and loop optimization just as an arithmetic operator would be.

> The `const` attribute specifies that a function does not examine any values except their arguments, and have no effects except the return value. Note that a function that has pointer arguments and examines the data pointed to must not be declared const. Likewise, a function that calls a non-`const` function usually must not be `const`. It does not make sense for a `const` function to return `void`.

~~~{objective-c}
int square(int n) __attribute__((const));
~~~

`pure` and `const` are both attributes that invoke a functional programming paradigm in order to allow for significant performance optimizations. `const` can be thought as a stricter form of `pure` since it doesn't depend on global values or pointers.

For example, because the result of a function declared `const` does not depend on anything other than the arguments passed in, the result of the function can cache that result and return any time the function is called with that same combination of arguments. (i.e. we know that the square of a number is constant, so we only need to compute it once).

### `unused`

> This attribute, attached to a function, means that the function is meant to be possibly unused. GCC will not produce a warning for this function.

The same effect can be accomplished with the `__unused` keyword. Declare this on parameters that are not used in the method implementation. Knowing that little bit of context allows the compiler to make optimizations accordingly. You're most likely to use `__unused` in delegate method implementations, since protocols frequently provide more context than is often necessary, in order to satisfy a large number of potential use cases.

Like many features of GCC, Clang supports `__attribute__`, adding its own small set of extensions.

To check the availability of a particular attribute, you can use the `__has_attribute` directive.

### `availability`

> Clang introduces the availability attribute, which can be placed on declarations to describe the lifecycle of that declaration relative to operating system versions. Consider the function declaration for a hypothetical function f:

~~~{objective-c}
void f(void) __attribute__((availability(macosx,introduced=10.4,deprecated=10.6,obsoleted=10.7)));
~~~

> The `availability` attribute states that `f` was introduced in Mac OS X 10.4, deprecated in Mac OS X 10.6, and obsoleted in Mac OS X 10.7.

> This information is used by Clang to determine when it is safe to use `f`: for example, if Clang is instructed to compile code for Mac OS X 10.5, a call to f() succeeds. If Clang is instructed to compile code for Mac OS X 10.6, the call succeeds but Clang emits a warning specifying that the function is deprecated. Finally, if Clang is instructed to compile code for Mac OS X 10.7, the call fails because `f()` is no longer available.

> The `availability` attribute is a comma-separated list starting with the platform name and then including clauses specifying important milestones in the declaration's lifetime (in any order) along with additional information.

- `introduced`: The first version in which this declaration was introduced.
- `deprecated`: The first version in which this declaration was deprecated, meaning that users should migrate away from this API.
- `obsoleted`: The first version in which this declaration was obsoleted, meaning that it was removed completely and can no longer be used.
- `unavailable`: This declaration is never available on this platform.
- `message` Additional message text that Clang will provide when emitting a warning or error about use of a deprecated or obsoleted declaration. Useful to direct users to replacement APIs.

> Multiple availability attributes can be placed on a declaration, which may correspond to different platforms. Only the availability attribute with the platform corresponding to the target platform will be used; any others will be ignored. If no availability attribute specifies availability for the current target platform, the availability attributes are ignored.

Supported Platforms:

- `ios`: Apple’s iOS operating system. The minimum deployment target is specified by the `-mios-version-min=*version*` or `-miphoneos-version-min=*version*` command-line arguments.
- `macosx`: Apple’s Mac OS X operating system. The minimum deployment target is specified by the `-mmacosx-version-min=*version*` command-line argument.

### `overloadable`

> Clang provides support for C++ function overloading in C. Function overloading in C is introduced using the `overloadable` attribute. For example, one might provide several overloaded versions of a `tgsin` function that invokes the appropriate standard function computing the `sine` of a value with `float`, `double`, or `long double` precision:

~~~{objective-c}
#include <math.h>
float __attribute__((overloadable)) tgsin(float x) { return sinf(x); }
double __attribute__((overloadable)) tgsin(double x) { return sin(x); }
long double __attribute__((overloadable)) tgsin(long double x) { return sinl(x); }
~~~

Note that `overloadable` only works for functions. You can overload method declarations to some extent by using generic return and parameter types, like `id` and `void *`.

Context is king when it comes to compiler optimizations. By providing constraints on how to interpret your code, you're increases the chance that the generated code is as efficient as possible. Meet your compiler half-way, and you'll always be rewarded.

And `__attribute__` isn't just for the compiler either: The next person to see the code will appreciate the extra context, too. So go the extra mile for the benefit of your collaborator, successor, or just 2-years-from-now-(and-you've-forgotten-everything-about–this-code) you.

Because in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make.
