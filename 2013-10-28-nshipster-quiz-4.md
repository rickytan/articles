The fourth and final NSHipster pub quiz of the year was held in the beautiful city of Amsterdam on October 22nd, with help from the good folks at [Appsterdam](http://appsterdam.rs), [The Big Nerd Ranch](http://www.bignerdranch.com/), and [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com).

The competition was fierce, but ultimately the team of [Mike Lee](https://twitter.com/bmf), [Judy Chen](https://twitter.com/judykitteh), [Eloy Dúran](https://twitter.com/alloy), [Alexander Repty](https://twitter.com/arepty), [Maxie Ketschau-Repty](https://twitter.com/Yumyoko), and [Sernin van de Krol](https://twitter.com/paneidos) were victorious. This was, by design, to be the highest-scoring of any pub quiz, with generous portions of extra points, and Team "[Graceful Hoppers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper)" came through with an impressive 53 points (which, interestingly enough, only edged out the 2nd place team by ½ of a point).

As always, you can play along at home or at work with your colleagues. Here are the rules:

- There are 4 Rounds, with 10 questions each
- Record answers on a separate sheet of paper
- Each correct answer to a question gets you 1 point (unless otherwise specified)
- Play with up to 5 friends for maximum enjoyment
- Don't be lame and look things up on the Internet or in Xcode

Round 1: General Knowledge
--------------------------

Current events, miscellaneous tidbits, and random trivia. Following a time-honored traditions for NSHipster quizzes, the first round is always a mis-mash of people, places, and pop culture.



Round 2: Foundation Potpourri
-----------------------------

With the fluff out of the way, it's now time to dive into some hardcore Cocoa fundamentals. How well do _you_ know the standard library?



Round 4: NSAnagram
------------------

And finally, an admittedly _sadistic_ round that combines wordplay with Cocoa arcana. Each question is an anagram, whose letters can be rearranged to form the name of a class or type in a well-known system framework (hint: Foundation, Core Foundation, UIKit, and AddressBook are represented here). Good luck!

1. Nose Call
2. Uncle Consort Inn
3. Oi! Inaccurate Wit Vividity
4. A Band's Cement Jog
5. Tartan's Screech
6. Kebab's Sad Odor
7. Macs Fret
8. Manservant of Rulers
9. Measurably Rant
10. Ill-Oiled Canonicalized Tuxedo
