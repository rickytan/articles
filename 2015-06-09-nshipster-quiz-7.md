On June 9th, we organized the third annual WWDC edition of the NSHipster Pub Quiz, with topics ranging from pop cultural trivia to technical pedantry. A huge thanks to [Realm](https://realm.io), who opened their offices and hosted with aplomb the scores of developers who turned out for the quiz.

With dozens of teams competing for the prizes on offer, competition was fierce. After the final tally, Team "U+1F4A9" (aka "üí© PILE OF POO") took the top prize with a score of 35 points. Congratulations to [Benjamin Encz](https://twitter.com/benjaminencz), [Dave Verwer](https://twitter.com/daveverwer), [Emilio Pel√°ez](https://twitter.com/emiliopelaez), [Jeffrey Bergier](https://twitter.com/jeffburg), [Michael Helmbrecht](https://twitter.com/mrh_is), and [Warren Moore](https://twitter.com/warrenm) on the win!

As always, you can play along at home or at work with your colleagues. Here are the rules:

- Four rounds of ten questions each
- Record your answers on a separate sheet of paper
- Each correct answer to a question gets you 1 point (unless otherwise specified)
- Play with up to five friends for maximum enjoyment
- Don't be lame and look things up on the Internet or in Xcode
