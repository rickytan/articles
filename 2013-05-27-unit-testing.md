Unit Testing is an emotional topic for developers. It inspires a sense of superiority to its most zealous adherents, and evokes a feeling of inadequacy to non-practitioners. [Cargo Cults like TDD](http://ntoll.org/article/tdd-cargo-cult) stake their reputation on unit testing to the point of co-opting and conflating utility with morality.

It's as close to a religious matter as programmers get, aside from the tabs-versus-spaces debate.

Objective-C developers have, for the most part, remained relatively apathetic to Unit Testing (_"There's that SenTest thing, but who uses that, really?"_). Between static typing, typically manageable project sizes, and a compiler advanced enough to [rewrite code for you](http://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/Rewriter_8h_source.html), unit testing isn't as much of a necessity as it is for more dynamic languages like Ruby (at least in practice).

But that's not to say that Objective-C developers wouldn't benefit from unit testing. In fact, as Objective-C continues to become more collaborative, with growing participation in the open source community, automated testing will become a necessity.

This week NSHipster will explore the world of unit testing frameworks, and how to set up an automated build system with Travis CI.

[Unit Testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) is a tool, just like any other tool. Its purpose is to make us better at our jobs, which is to produce robust, maintainable software.

It's a simple enough premise: write code to construct environments that exercise the particular behavior of a given method, function, class, or feature. Variables are isolated in a scientific manner, so as to test assumptions with logical atomicity.

## OCUnit

[OCUnit](http://www.sente.ch/software/ocunit/), a.k.a. SenTestingKit, was integrated into Xcode 2.1 circa WWDC 2005, [as a result of its use in the development of Core Data 1.0](http://www.friday.com/bbum/2005/09/24/unit-testing). Developed by [Sen:te](http://www.sente.ch), OCUnit is actually one of the first unit testing libraries written for any language.

Unit Tests were added into a separate testing target in the Xcode Project. Each test file defines an `SenTestCase` subclass, which implements a series of methods beginning with the word `test`. C `assert`-style macros are used to fail tests if the specified condition is not met. Each test is run in sequence, independently of one another, with the results logged afterwards:

~~~{objective-c}
#import <SenTestingKit/SenTestingKit.h>
#import "Person.h"

@interface TestPerson : SenTestCase
@end

@implementation TestPerson
- (void)testFullName {
   Person *person = [[Person alloc] init];
   person.firstName = @"Pablo";
   person.lastName = @"Picasso";
   STAssertEqualObjects([person fullName], @"Pablo Picasso", nil);
}
~~~

The SenTestingKit assertions are about what you'd expect, offering bread-and-butter equality, existence, and truth checks:

- `STAssertNil()`
- `STAssertNotNil()`
- `STAssertTrue()`
- `STAssertFalse()`
- `STAssertEqualObjects()`
- `STAssertEquals()`
- `STAssertEqualsWithAccuracy()`
- `STAssertThrows()`
- `STAssertThrowsSpecific()`
- `STAssertThrowsSpecificNamed()`
- `STAssertNoThrow()`
- `STAssertNoThrowSpecific()`
- `STAssertNoThrowSpecificNamed()`
- `STAssertTrueNoThrow()`
- `STAssertFalseNoThrow()`
- `STFail()`

And yet, as useful as tests are, they necessarily introduce friction into a development cycle. When project pressures begin to weigh, tests are the first thing to be thrown overboard. At some point, the tests stop passing ("we can worry about that laterâ€”now we have to ship!")

The only chance testing has to remain relevant in high-pressure situations is to reduce that friction in development. Essentially, tests need to become both _easier to write_ and _easier to run_.

## Open Source Libraries

There are a myriad of open source libraries that attempt to make testing more palatable by way of syntactic sugar and features like [method stubs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_stub), [mock objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object), and [promises](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises).

Here's a list of some of the most useful open source libraries for unit testing:

## Automated Testing

Making tests easier to write is one thing, but getting them to run without affecting productivity is quite another.


### Jenkins

For a long time, installing [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org) on a dedicated Mac Mini was the state-of-the-art for automated build servers.

Aside from the fact that it's _kinda the worst thing ever to set-up_, [you can do a lot of cool things](https://speakerdeck.com/subdigital/ios-build-automation-with-jenkins) like notifying build status over IM or IRC, automatically distributing builds to [TestFlight](https://testflightapp.com/dashboard/) or [HockeyApp](http://hockeyapp.net) with [Shenzhen](https://github.com/nomad/shenzhen), and generating documentation with [AppleDoc](http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/).

### Travis

Until recently, automated unit testing for Objective-C was the privilege of projects that could dedicate the time and money to setup a CI server. [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) made CI available to the masses.

CI for Objective-C is more difficult than for other languages, because it needs to be done on a Mac. For economic reasons, there just isn't a market for cloud-based OS X environments like there is for Linux. Fortunately, [SauceLabs](https://saucelabs.com) has built such a virtualized Mac cloud, and is graciously donating some of it to run tests for open source Objective-C projects on Travis-CI.

For an example of automated Objective-C unit testing in the wild, check out [how AFNetworking does it](https://github.com/afnetworking/afnetworking#unit-tests).

The `Tests` subdirectory contains separate projects for iOS and OS X targets, as well as a Podfile, which specifies all of the testing library dependencies. AFNetworking executes a [Rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org) task, which shells out to [`xctool`](https://github.com/facebook/xctool).

All of the configuration for setup is defined in `.travis.yml`:

#### .travis.yml

~~~
language: objective-c
before_install:
  - brew update
  - brew install xctool --HEAD
  - cd Tests && pod install && cd $TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR
  - mkdir -p "Tests/AFNetworking Tests.xcodeproj/xcshareddata/xcschemes" && cp Tests/Schemes/*.xcscheme "Tests/AFNetworking Tests.xcodeproj/xcshareddata/xcschemes/"
script: rake test
~~~

Full documentation for the Travis configuration file [can be found on Travis-CI.org](http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/build-configuration/).

Once again, the direction of Objective-C has been directly influenced by the Ruby community. Those guys and gals are _serious_ about testing. It's not like we should complain, though: between [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org), [RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion.com), and [Nomad](http://nomad-cli.com), Ruby has made Objective-C development better by several orders of magnitude.

The bottom line is that testing has come to Objective-C. It's not always necessary, and it's certainly not a silver bullet for writing great software, but it's proven itself invaluable (especially for open source development). So give it a try now, before _not_ testing becomes _seriously uncool_.
